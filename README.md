type-inference
--------------

This package contains literate Haskell implementations of three
unification algorithms (for the free theory, abelian groups and
higher-order pattern unification) and two type inference algorithms
(for the Hindley-Milner type system and Kennedy-style units of
measure).  It accompanies the Ph.D. thesis "Type Inference, Haskell
and Dependent Types" by Adam Gundry.
